*Simple Kinect Touch Compilation Instructions:*

Requirements:

* OpenNi SDK installed (download from www.openni.org). 

 NOTE:If your cpu is AMD without sse3 support you have to compile OpenNi yourself. 
 You will NOT be able to use the binaries. To compile download the sources and change 
 the general makefile where it says sse default from 3 to 2. Then follow instructions from
 readme you got from openni. 

* Avin Drivers for Kinect (Instead of Primesensor, find them in git). 

 NOTE: Same as OpenNi. For these the max FPS will be 20 (the drivers appear 
 use ssse3 to speed things up). 

* OpenCV 2.2 (Lastest from subversion, compiled with OPENNI and QT)
 
 Find, download and Follow the instructions from the page opencv.willowgarage.com 

* CvBlobsLib (Included for linux, else download from : )

* TUIO implementation for c++ (Included for linux license: GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE included, else download: www.tuio.org)
